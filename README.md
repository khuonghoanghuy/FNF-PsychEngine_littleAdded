# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Little Added
Made this engine cuz idk bored time :l

Base of Psych Engine ofc why not.

Little Added Engine mosty like a Psych Engine come with alot of Lua Script API for using to making mods include:
- Resize Windows
- Change Cursor Mouse
- Exit
And Many more will come

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Using `hmm` and type `haxelib run hmm install` in Command prompt/PowerShell

If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.
